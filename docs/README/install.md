## Install

[Download Zentaps](https://github.com/zengabor/zentaps/archive/latest.zip) and include it into your page. A good place is at the very bottom, just before the closing `</body>` tag. For&nbsp;example:

````html
    ...
    <script src="zentaps-min.js"></script>
</body>
````

There is nothing else to do. Zentaps automatically detects touch-capable browsers that need a speed-up.

You can also use npm to install Zenscroll:

````
npm install zentaps
````
